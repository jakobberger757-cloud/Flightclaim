- `email_capture_medium_confidence` — medium confidence inline capture
- `email_capture_not_eligible` — not eligible soft capture
- `inbound_email` — forwarded email to claims@flightclaim.today

## Result States (analytics)

- `eligible_low_confidence` (65-69%)
- `wrong_email_type`

## Inbound Email Flow
1. User forwards airline email to claims@flightclaim.today
2. Resend MX record (Cloudflare DNS) receives it
3. Resend webhook POSTs to /inbound on Railway
4. Server fetches full email body via GET /emails/receiving/{email_id}
5. Forwards full email to OPERATOR_EMAIL
6. Saves row to Supabase with source=inbound_email
7. Operator reviews and follows up manually

## What Is Live ✅
- Analysis flow end to end
- Email sending via Resend
- Supabase capture on all paths
- Operator alert on claim submission (email to OPERATOR_EMAIL)
- Original email text stored on all captures
- Inbound email forwarding (claims@flightclaim.today)
- Custom domain + Cloudflare DNS
- Terms + Privacy pages

## What Is NOT Live Yet
- Automated claim filing (manual follow-up for now)
- Stripe / payment collection
- Email follow-up sequences
- RLS on Supabase

## Operator Workflow (current)
1. User submits claim → operator alert email sent instantly with full details
2. User forwards email to claims@flightclaim.today → row in Supabase + operator forwarded
3. All leads visible in Supabase → filter by source = claim_form_submitted for active queue
4. Follow up manually by email
5. Use notes column in Supabase to track claim status

## Key Product Rules
- Accepted rebooking → NOT eligible (shown post-analysis, not pre)
- Never guarantee refunds — always "appears eligible"
- Not a law firm
- 20% fee disclosed everywhere
- Not affiliated with airlines or DOT

## Priorities
1. Get first real users (Reddit)
2. Handle first claims manually
3. Confirm airlines actually pay out
4. Add Stripe once validated
5. Automate filing after that
